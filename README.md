# Verifiable Merkle Trees

## Summary

VMTrees use merkle trees combined with cryptographic proof for a variety of use cases such as anonymous airdrops, governance voting and privacy mixers.  Utilizing Chainlink's Decentralized Oracle Network, computation happens off chain which solves the problem of high gas fees.
